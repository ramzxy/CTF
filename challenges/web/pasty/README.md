## Description

Check out our new secure pastebin service! We rolled our own cryptographic signatures to protect paste access - after all, why trust those boring standard libraries when you can build something custom?

Can you prove that our homebrewed crypto isn't as secure as we think and get access to the 'flag' paste?
